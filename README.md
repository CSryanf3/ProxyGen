# ProxyGen

## About
- ProxyGen is a proxy card generator. It uses PyFPDF to create a PDF of cards out of a text file.
- 9 cards are created per page, and an unlimited number of cards/pages can be created.
- Select a .txt file (like `cards.txt`) with the card text you'd like to include in the format `Title/Subtext/Text`.
- After selecting 'Run', the proxies will be in the `test.pdf` file.

## Options
- **Adjustable Font** - Font will adjust to fit the card.
- **Timestamp** - Display the timestamp on the pages.
- **Preview PDF** - Preview the PDF after run.
- **Page Number** - Display the page number on the pages.
